To modify a commit message for a pushed commit in IntelliJ IDEA, you will need to perform a force push after amending the commit message. Please note that this may cause issues for other team members who have already pulled the changes, so use this method with caution and communicate with your team.

Here are the steps to modify a commit message for a pushed commit in IntelliJ IDEA:

    Open your project in IntelliJ IDEA.
    Click on the "VCS" menu (or "Git" in newer versions) in the top menu bar.
    Select "Git" > "Log" to open the Version Control Log window.
    In the Log window, find the commit with the message you want to change. You can use the search bar or browse the list of commits.
    Right-click on the commit, and select "Interactively Rebase from Here" from the context menu.
    In the "Git Interactive Rebase" window, select the commit with the message you want to change, then click the "Edit Commit Message" button (the pencil icon) at the top of the window.
    Update the commit message in the new dialog, then click "Save".
    Click "Start Rebasing" in the "Git Interactive Rebase" window. This will change the commit message locally.
    Now you need to force push the changes to the remote repository. Open the "Terminal" in IntelliJ IDEA (it's usually located at the bottom of the window).
    In the Terminal, enter the following command to force push the changes:

python

git push --force-with-lease origin <branch_name>

Replace <branch_name> with the name of the branch you're working on.

This command will force push the changes to the remote repository, updating the commit message for the pushed commit. Remember that force pushing can cause issues for other team members, so make sure to communicate the changes and proceed with caution.
